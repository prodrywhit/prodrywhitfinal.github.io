<h2 class="center-header">WHO AM I?</h2> 
 
</div class="center">
 <p>FROM A SMALL CITY IN CT, I AM A MUSICIAN THROUGH AND THROUGH. WITH LOVE FOR PRODUCTION, DRUMS, AND THE ARTISTRY OF MUSIC I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS TO EXPRESS MYSELF TO THE WORLD AROUND ME. GROWING UP I ALWAYS USED TO SPEND MY SUMMERS DOWN AT THE SKATEPARK WHERE THE ONLY THREE THINGS ON MY MIND WAS MY BOARD, MY MUSIC FOR THE SESH, AND MY HOMIES. IM ALWAYS TRANSPORTED BACK INTO THIS TIME IN MY LIFE, AND THE OLDER I GET THE MORE IT HAPPENS. THIS ALWAYS TOLD ME TO STICK WITH THESE THINGS AND LET THEM GUIDE YOU THROUGH LIFE. FROM DOING EVERY POSSIBLE MUSIC GROUP IN MY HIGHSCHOOL, TO BUILDING UP A HOME STUDIO FOR MYSELF, I HAVE TAKEN LOTS OF TIME TO LEARN AND EXPERIENCE THE WORLD OF MUSIC AND MY CREATIVE ABILITY IN ALL REGARDS. MY BIGGEST GOAL IN LIFE IS TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYONE, WHETHER IT IS BY PROVIDING MY SERVICES TO OTHER MUSICIANS, OR ITS SHARING MY PERSONAL MUSIC FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD, I WANT TO BE APART OF THE CREATIVE WORLD AND WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER.</p>
