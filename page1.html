<h2 class="center-header">WHO AM I?</h2> 

<h3 class="center-header">BIO:</h3>
 
</div class="center">
 <p>FROM A SMALL CITY IN CT, I AM A MUSICIAN THROUGH AND THROUGH. WITH LOVE FOR PRODUCTION, DRUMS, AND THE ARTISTRY OF MUSIC I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS TO EXPRESS MYSELF TO THE WORLD AROUND ME. GROWING UP I ALWAYS USED TO SPEND MY SUMMERS DOWN AT THE SKATEPARK WHERE THE ONLY THREE THINGS ON MY MIND WAS MY BOARD, MY MUSIC FOR THE SESH, AND MY HOMIES. IM ALWAYS TRANSPORTED BACK INTO THIS TIME IN MY LIFE, AND THE OLDER I GET THE MORE IT HAPPENS. THIS ALWAYS TOLD ME TO STICK WITH THESE THINGS AND LET THEM GUIDE YOU THROUGH LIFE. FROM DOING EVERY POSSIBLE MUSIC GROUP IN MY HIGHSCHOOL, TO BUILDING UP A HOME STUDIO FOR MYSELF, I HAVE TAKEN LOTS OF TIME TO LEARN AND EXPERIENCE THE WORLD OF MUSIC AND MY CREATIVE ABILITY IN ALL REGARDS. MY BIGGEST GOAL IN LIFE IS TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYONE, WHETHER IT IS BY PROVIDING MY SERVICES TO OTHER MUSICIANS, OR ITS SHARING MY PERSONAL MUSIC FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD, I WANT TO BE APART OF THE CREATIVE WORLD AND WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER.</p>

<h4 class="center-header">ARTIST STATEMENT:</h4> 

</div class="center">
<p>COMING INTO AN OVERSATURATED FIELD, I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WAS GOING TO SET ME APART IN THIS INDUSTRY. I PUT ALL MY FAITH INTO CONTINUING TO BE THE PUREST VERSION OF MYSELF, GOOD AND BAD INCLUDED. HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY SPACE AND THE LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES OF LIFE, I MAKE ETHERAL SOUNDING MELODIES COUPLED WITH HARD, COMPLEX DRUMS TO CONFUSE YOU FROM BOTH SIDES. IVE ALWAYS BEEN HEAVILY DRIVEN BY THE TRUTH, AND ALWAYS STICKING TO IT NO MATTER HOW GOOD OR BAD IT MAY BE. I CANT SAY IVE ALWAYS BEEN A PERFECT PERSON, BUT I HOPE THAT THROUGH SHARING MY STORIES AND EMOTION THROUGH THE MUSIC, I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT MY MUSIC TO BE. I WANT TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO CHASE THEIR DREAMS JUST AS MUCH AS IM OUT HERE CHASING MINE, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINKING FINDING AND ANSWERING TO YOUR CALLING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS LIFE HAS HAD TO OFFER ME SO FAR.</p>
